# machine-learning-with-python-examples
Contains examples of machine learning with Python

Some very basic examples in machine learning. Have included un-common examples (other than the iris dataset). Have attempted to create algorithms examples for varied datasets:


Supervised Learning Projects

ML problem: Predict Animal Type (Mammal/Bird etc) based on Features
Algorithms: Decission Trees, Gaussian Algorithm, Regressions, random forests
Data: Zoo Dataset, Boston Housing Dataset
Technologies: pandas, python, sklearn


Drivers Fleet Data Analysis for Unsupervised Learning

ML problem: Determine clusters from the drivers-fleet data and plot
Algorithms: KMeans, Hierarchical Algorithm, DBScan
Data: delivery fleet driver data [https://www.nrel.gov/]
Technologies: pandas, python, sklearn

Dimensional Reduction implemented for IRIS Dataset

Twitter stream

ML problem: Location based sentiment analysis of #NipahVirus
Algorithms: sentiment analysis with Data visualization
Data: Twitter API, Live Stream
Technologies: tweepy, nltk, pandas, python, sklearn

Stock price prediction

A time series prediction of gold stocks, so traders or bots can gamble based on these predictions.
ML problem: time series prediction
Algorithms: ARIMA, regression
Technologies: sklearn
Data: Quandl
