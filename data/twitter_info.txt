Algorithms take vectors of numbers as input, therefore we need to convert documents to fixed-length vectors of numbers.

 convert text to word count vectors with CountVectorizer.
 convert text to word frequency vectors with TfidfVectorizer.
 convert text to unique integers with HashingVectorizer.

The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents - 
 and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.

You can use it as follows:

Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.
Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more documents.
Call the transform() function on one or more documents as needed to encode each as a vector.
